    <h1>Games Sales Website</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Topic Overview</h2>

        <p>The general topic for <a href="./project_web_page/index.html">this project</a> is discounts on different game launchers. There are different vendors in
            the gaming world and they don't synchronize their discounts most of the time. You have to manually go from
            one launcher to the next to see if a game is on sale. This takes a lot of time because some launchers can
            take a minute or two to open and if you are visiting five or size of them it could take anywhere between ten
            and fifteen minutes to see if there are better deals.</p>
        <p>There are currently very few or no websites that do specifically collect sales data and show it. There are
            websites that show you discounts but make you buy them on their website, and there are websites that just
            sell game keys at lower rates, but none that I can see link you back to the original website that actually
            made the sale in the first place. Not having to go through a third party payment method would be extremely
            useful and probably save people money.</p>

        <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
        <p>My proposition for my group is to pick three of these websites and build individual webpages for each. We
            should access the API's for these websites and collect the information that each site has about that game.
            My ideas for which cites to use and with a link to their associated api's are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home">Steam</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs">The Epic
                    Store</a></li>
            <li> <a
                    href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/rest-api-reference-windows-store-for-business">Microsoft
                    Store</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is a possibility that the api's won't be compatible with this idea. So an alternative is that we make
            an app that looks at different facets of Steam. Steam's api is excellent and with it I can collect all of
            the games on sale. Someone else can do a search to see if steam has a specific game. The third person might
            have something related to new regarding games that a user searches. Either way we will also need a homepage
            that can redirect us to each of the three different functionalities and a description of what the website is
            and what each function will do.</p>
