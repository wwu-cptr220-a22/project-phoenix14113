  <h1>Steam Sales Description</h1>
  <p>
    This website is designed so that you can see exclusively what is on sale on steam at any given time. I want to be
    able to provide people with an easier, more covienient, and better formatted way of seeing what is on sale than
    steam or other third party websites that also show the rest of the steam database.
