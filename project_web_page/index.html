      <p>
        This website is designed to cater to the friendly gamers out there who are also frugal. We all know the feeling
        of looking at a game that we want to play with our friend and saying "Phew! That is way too expensive!". The
        patient gamer will just wait until the game is on sale before buying it. Putting a game on your steam wishlist
        is an easy process, but the games that your friends own are something that constantly expanding. Not only this
        but you have to click in and go to the store page for each item your friend owns. Then you might be tempted to
        get something that is not on sale.

      <h2>Website Overview</h2>

      <p>The general idea for this website is displaying discounted games from your steam library. Steam doesn't have an
        incredible way of showing you what is on sale at any given moment. You have to manually search for a game or
        just find it on the friends page and click into each game manually. This takes a lot of time because you have to
        search for them each individually, got to their page, and then back to the home page or your friends page for
        another search. This makes it a lot easier to spend money because you have to look at all of the game, including
        the ones not on sale, to analyze your friend's games.</p>
      <img id="controller" src="./img//clipart2078827.png" alt="controller picture" />
      <p>There are currently very few or no websites that specifically collect sales data from your friends on steam and
        show it in an organized fassion. There are websites that show you discounts but make you buy them on their
        website, and there are websites that just sell game keys at lower rates, but none that I can see link you back
        to the original website that actually made the sale in the first place. Not having to go through a third party
        payment method would be extremely useful and probably save people money.</p>

        <h2>About the project</h2>

        <p>This project uses an API to collect steam librarys, and then pick out only the ones on sale for your viewing
          pleasure. Unlike other websites I will not show you any other categories other than steam sales. I will show
          you the header picture for the game, its name, the current price, and how much it is on discount for. No full
          priced games and no filtering results. This is purely designed as a way to browse games currently on sale. The
          only order to the games is that of collecting all of the sales games from the API. I hope this feels more like
          a randomized viewing experience than one organized and designed to show you the most popular items. Go to the
          <a href="./GamesTable.html">"<u>Sales table</u>"</a> tab to view this table of sales games

        <h2>Why This Site</h2>

        <p>You should use this site if you are just wanting to browse a friend's games that are on sale. There are no
          extra parameters to this part of the website. There is only on text field to enter data for your SteamID,
          nothing else to clutter the page. This site is for the people who want a simple website and nothing else.
          Enjoy the scrolling with out pop out windows, ads, auto play videos, or any other kind of distractions.</p>
