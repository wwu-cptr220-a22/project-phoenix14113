      <p>
        This website is designed to cater to the gamers out there who are also frugal. We all know the feeling of
        looking
        at a game and saying "Phew! That is way too expensive!". The patient gamer will just wait until the game is on
        sale before buying it. If you put the game on your steam wishlist this is an easy process, but what if you
        like
        the game but not enough to put it on your wishlist? Or what if you want to "window shop" the steam store but
        you
        only are wanting to look at games on discount so that you aren't tempted to buy something at full price?
      </p>

      <h2>Website Overview</h2>

      <p>The general idea for this website is displaying discounted games on Steam. Steam doesn't have an incredible
        way
        of showing you what is on sale at any given moment. You have to manually search for a game or just find it on
        the main page to the next to see if a game is on sale. This takes a lot of time because you have to search for
        them each individually, got to their page, and then back to the home page for another search. And sometimes
        your
        search isn't at the top of the list so you have to look through a list anyway.</p>
      <img id="controller" src="./img//clipart2078827.png" alt="controller picture" />
      <p>There are currently very few or no websites that specifically collect sales data from steam and show it in an
        organized fassion. There are websites that show you discounts but make you buy them on their website, and
        there
        are websites that just sell game keys at lower rates, but none that I can see link you back to the original
        website that actually made the sale in the first place. Not having to go through a third party payment method
        would be extremely useful and probably save people money.</p>

        <h2>About the project</h2>

        <p>This project uses an API to collect steam sales and display them for your viewing pleasure. Unlike other
          websites I will not show you any other categories other than steam sales. I will show your the header picture
          for the game, its name, the current price, and how much it is on discount for. No full priced games and no
          searching. This is purely designed as a way to brows games currently on sale. The only order to the games is
          that of collecting all of the sales games from the API. I hope this feels more like a randomized viewing
          experience than one organized and designed to show you the most popular items. Go to the <a
            href="./GamesTable.html">"<u>Sales table</u>"</a> tab to view this table of sales games</p>
